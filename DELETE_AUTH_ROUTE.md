2. **Delete by ID**: `DELETE /api/athlete/{yourId}`
3. **Verify deletion** - Check database or try to find again
4. **Recreate** - Use signup flow to create new athlete
5. **Repeat** - Perfect for testing!

### Bulk Cleanup
1. **Get multiple athlete IDs** from database
2. **Bulk delete**: `DELETE /api/athlete/bulk` with array of IDs
3. **Verify cleanup** - Check database is clean
4. **Start fresh** - Ready for new testing
